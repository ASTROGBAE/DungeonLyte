Room[Outside]: Before you is a mysterious mansion, shrouded in mist. 
You've come here seeking the oracle who lives within, it is said she will grant the entrant any wish they desire!

Door[Vestibule]: There is an engraved, double door facing you. 
Lock[Front key]: The mansion door is locked. 
Key[A rusty key]: The mansion door is unlocked. It creaks in the wind, 
as if almost falling off its hinges. 

Door[Hedge entrance]: Around the side you see a suprisingly well-kept hedge, towering above your own height. 
A fallen gateway signals an opening in the hedge, big enough for you to walk through. 
The ground there is thin, clean gravel.

Door[The road behind you]: Behind you, a cracked cement road shows the track on which you came here.
Lock[]: What? You want to leave already? You're here for the oracle!
